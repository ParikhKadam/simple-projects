# simple-projects
This repo contains some of my time-pass projects which I had created for fun OR for Information purpose OR just to see what can I do with programming.

#Python
1. tutorialpoint.com_Extractor.py : This is program to extract a tutorial from the website tutorialpoint.com. It combines all the individual pages of the tutorial into a single HTML document and then a corresponding pdf is created. Both the files are available after completion of the program. It can be modified to do download any tutorial from the tutorialpoint.com . You need a working pdfcrowd.com account which will provide you with username and apikey. INSERT YOUR OWN USERNAME AND APIKEY ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK.

2. facets.la_downloader.py : Downloads all the availble wallpaper from http://www.facets.la .

3. way2.py : This program uses way2sms.com to send a sms, but just by using a python script. You have to INSERT YOUR OWN USERNAME, PASSWORD AND RECEIVERS_NUMBER ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK. You can also convert it to a command line tool.


#C
1. bullsAndCows.c : This is a implementation of "Bulls and Cows" logic game. More info about the game at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows .
