# simple-projects
This repo contains some of my time-pass projects which I had created for fun OR for Information purpose OR just to see what can I do with programming.

#Python
1. tutorialpoint.com_Extractor: This is program to extract a tutorial from the website tutorialpoint.com. It combines all the individual pages of the tutorial into a single HTML document and then a corresponding pdf is created. Both the files are available after completion of the program. It can be modified to do download any tutorial from the tutorialpoint.com . You need a working pdfcrowd.com account which will provide you with username and apikey. INSERT YOUR OWN USERNAME AND APIKEY ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK.
